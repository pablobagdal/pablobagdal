I've been studying in Tomsk state university (Tomsk, Russia) for 6 years. Originally from Tomsk, Russia.

My very first programming experience was Pascal at school years, when I was about 12 years old. Thanks Alexandr Sergeevich Chervonniy for making me like and enjoy this thing for whole next life!

From 2016 to 2020 I graduated from TSU with bachelor's degree and whole time practiced C++ coding. 

Starting from Nov 2021 to Dec 2022, had been working on "Social media app" creation in startup called "Notos" (https://notos.me). Some things went wrong and development was freezed for unknown period. It was based on Dart language with Flutter SDK.

Since that project I fell in love with mobile development. Have many useful ideas, but still didn't achieved them. I swear myself soon I will update this text with links to this apps. Sure that they will be useful for you.

Since 2022 I do a lot of teaching on C++, Python, Java and many other languages. You can find out my courses on Stepik platform:
